# Presentation: "What I've Learned"

This is the presentation I gave to [DevBootCamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) Chicago on 10/24/2103.

The constraints for the presentation were:

> Talks tend to be less technical and more high-level. Topics like:
> 
> - Your experience in the industry 
> - How you got into programming
> - How you grew from a beginner to an actual developer
> - How you run your company
> - What you look for when you're growing a team
> - How you build a team, etc, etc.

The inspiration for this talk came from [Mando Escamilla](https://twitter.com/mandoescamilla) and the talk [Tell Us Another Story, Grandpa: Lessons Learned Over 16 Years as a Developer](http://cascadiaruby.com/#tell-us-another-story-grandpa-lessons-learned-over-16-years-as-a-developer) which he gave at [CascadiaRuby](http://cascadiaruby.com/) in October of 2013. His talk was so powerful and so moving I scrapped my original idea in lieu of his. If my presentation sucks it's my failure to execute. His talk was brilliant.
