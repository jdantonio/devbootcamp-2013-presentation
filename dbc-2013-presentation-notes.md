# What I've Learned

* I wrote my first computer program in 1988
* I was a freshman at the University of Colorado studying Architectural Engineering
* I was required to take a Fortran class
* I was scared to death--I knew nothing about computers
* I fell in love with programming and immediately changed my major

## Follow your passion

* I used to be embarrassed to use words like "love" and "passion" when talking about programming
* My sister used to be a social worker with Children's Services
* Rescuing children from abusive homes is work that requires passion
* But the truth is this: Programming computers appeals to a deeply emotional part of my being
* Rejecting that is far worse than accepting that

## Learn by doing

Unfortunately I had to take a break from school. Apparently, if you have no money and you are failing your classes they don't let you come back. Who knew?

At this time I was in the Army Reserves and I had an opportunity to attend PLDC (Primary Leadership Development Course).

* I was the youngest person in my class
* I was the lowest ranking person in my class
* The instructor kept assigning me leadership responsibilities
* It was obvious that the workload wasn't even
* One day I said "Sgt., if I didn'y know better I would think you are picking on me."
* He responded: "I am picking on you."
* As the youngest and lowest ranked attendee I was the least experienced and least likely to be able to apply these lessons when I got back to my unit
* So he gave me as many opportunities as possible

<hr />

* Some things can only be learned by doing
* Reading is a great way to get information
* But there is no substitute for experience
* The only way to become a great programmer is to write code
* And write lots of it

### Good leaders make decisions

So eventually we get to the final leadership exercise of the course. It was a tactical exercise. I was made the squad leader. I was scared to death but I did what I had to do. I surveyed my team to see who came from combat units and assigned them as my team leader. I assigned the teams to keep them balanced. And we head out. I regularly stopped the squad to make sure everyone was getting enough food and water. I regularly conferred with my team leaders, decided what to do next, and moved on. Eventually we reached the objective and made the assault. We immediately got wiped out.

It was an absolute slaughter. My squad was in a bad position and I moved us to early. We were picked off like sitting ducks. It was a horrible, horrible failure.

Our instructor moved us to a quiet hill so we could discuss what happened. He asked my how I thought I did. Feeling very low and embarrassed I proceeded to detail the litany of tactical mistakes I made.

Our instructor turned to the team and asked "How many people here agree that Jerry failed?" No on raised their hands. He then asked "How many people here would love to have a Private like Jerry in their unit?" Everyone raised their hand.

The instructor look at me and said: "Jerry, you still don't get it. This isn't a tactical comabt course. This is a *leadership* course."

<hr />

* Good leaders trust their team
* Good leaders value their team
* Good leaders listen to their team
* Good leaders take care of their team
* Good leaders take responsibility for their team
* Good leaders *lead* their team

## Work toward *your* potential

After a few years in the reserves I decided to enlist active duty (full time). For a number of reasons not worth describing I ended up on active duty in the Navy where I served on the USS Duluth LPD-6 (yes, I have bee to bootcamp *twice*). One of the wisest people I ever met was QMC (Chief Quartermaster) Fitzman.

While on the Duluth one of my teammates was Dennis. Dennis was one rank above me at the time. I was a QM3 and he was a QM2. I was amazing at my job and received much respect and many accolades for my work. Dennis, not so much.

Dennis had been in almost 20 years and was nearing retirement. Dennis hadn't been promoted in 10 years because he couldn't do well on the promotion exam. I wasn't Dennis' biggest fan.

One day I got really mad about something Dennis did (or failed to do--I can't remember). I started throwing a temper tantrum (again). Chief Fitzman decided he had enough and pulled me into the chartroom for a "conversation" (aka 'a really loud and angry butt-chewing')

"OK smartypants. You think you know everything. Prove it. You're the chief now. You get to decide what I do about Dennis. Decide. Now. What are you going to do."

Of course, I had no idea what to say. I hadn't given this any thought. I didn't need to: *I* wasn't the one in charge.

"Bust him" I said. "His skills aren't at the 2nd class level so bust him down 3rd."

"And that's why I'm the Chief and your the 3rd class" He said. "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You don't get it at all. I know that you're twice the QM Dennis. The Captain knows you're twice the QM Dennis is. All the bridge officers know you're twice the QM Dennis is. Do you who else knows you're twice the QM Dennis is? Dennis does!"

He continued: "Dennis knows that on his best day he can't keep up with you when you're hungover from partying all night. So instead of competing with you Dennis does what he can to *support* you. Dennis takes every crap job that you think is below you does it happily so you can concentrate on the harder job. Dennis makes sure to refer people to you when he knows you can answer their questions better. Dennis doesn't try to compete with you because he knows he can't. Dennis consistently does what's best for the team and doesn't complain about it."

"You, on the other hand," he continued (still at very high volume) "bith and whine and moan all the time. For all your talent you're never happy. You stay out all night whenever we're about to get underway and navigate us out of the harbor hungover and barely able to open your eyes and we let you do it *because you are that good*. But don't ever confuse being *good* with reaching your potential. Dennis consistently gives 100% day in and day out. You? I have no idea what 100% from you looks like because I've never seen it."

*"You may be 10-times the Quartermaster Dennis is but he's twice the sailor you are. And he's twice the sailor you'll ever be if you don't pull your head out of your ass."*

<hr />

* Every member of the team has their strengths
* The best teams maximize the potential of each team member
* Even when each member has a different potential
* Each member should give their best, regardless of where their *best* compares to that of their teammates

## Recognize the good in all you do

Eventually my four years in the Navy was up. I had a couple of very good opportunities available to me but I decided to get out. A career in the Navy wasn't my thing. The day I left I was awarded a Navy Achievement Medal and a Good Conduct medal. In my exit interview with Captain Stephens, who *really* wanted me to go to OCS, expressed a concern:

"QM2", he said, "I understand why many people choose to leave the service. My concern is that you may leave the Navy without fully appreciating what the Navy gave you."

"Captain Stephens" I said, "I promise you one this: I will *never* regret my time here in the Navy. Four years ago I was a young punk with no plan in life. Here on the Duluth I grew up. I've learned professionalism and responsibility. I've proudly served my country and I've seen the world. I've done things I never thought I would do. I'm not cut out for a career and I need to get out, but the Navy will *always* be a part of who I am. And I will *always* treasure that."

<hr />

* Some experiences will not live up to your expectations
* Some experiences will leave you feeling bitter and angry
* Everything you do becomes a part of you
* Find the good in everything and keep *that* close to your heart

## It's never too late to start

So I've now spent 3 years in the Army Reserves and 4 years in the Navy. I'm 25 years old (which seemed so *ancient* at the time--how things change). I had a few college credits from before I enlisted but basically I'm at ground zero. Really, what good were my skills at navigating ships going to do me in *Denver*? But I had the GI Bill. I had the Navy College Fund. And I still wanted to be a programmer.

<hr />

* If it's important to you then do it
* If you really care about something it's never too late to pursue it
* I now have four college degrees (2 masters degrees), I've been a professional programmer for almost 2 decades, and I have over 10 years experience teaching university classes part-time
* "Better late than never" isn't just a cute saying, it's deep wisdom

## Know where you want to go

My first tech job was as a technical support supervisor for an ISP. I wasn't a programmer yet but I was going to school studying programming and I was actively looking for a programmer gig. But I still worked as hard as I could at my current job (thanks to Chief Fitzman I had a much better work ethic now). I did such good work that I was being fast-tracked for a project manager position.

I had an opportunity to sit down with the director from a new project. The managers from my project recommended me personally and were as supportive and I could have ever asked them to be. So I'm in this meeting and this director tells me he's ready to hire me today. He's impressed with everything I've done, felt we got along very well, thought I would be a great asset, and wanted me on board ASAP to help him get the project off the ground. There was just one catch. He wanted me to drop out of school.

Call centers are 24x7 operations and managers need to be available at all hours. Managers on new projects need to work crazy hours to get the project off the ground. I was taking classes a couple nights a week working on my undergrad degree. He viewed this as a conflict and asked me to make a choice. So I did.

I turned down the job and left the company within a few months.

<hr />

* Sometimes it's hard to turn down something that's right in front of you
* Rarely is instant gratification really that gratifying
* Always ask yourself where you want to be in a year, three years, five years, etc.
* Make the choices that get you where you truly want to go

## Bad things *will* happen to you

When I was 26 years old my father passed away. He had a heart attack late on a Sunday evening and he was gone by the weekend. My relationship with my father was a complicated one. The kind of relationship I normally only talk about with my therapist at ridiculous cost to my insurance company. Be he was my father. He was the only family I had in Denver. My tech career was just taking off and he was proud of what I was accomplishing. And just like that he was gone.

<hr />

* Bad things *will* happen to you
* It's just an unfortunate reality that none of us will escape
* But you will survive
* I may take effort, it may take years, and in some extreme cases it may take professional help
* But you are far more resilient than you may realize
* And things will get better

## You will regret some decisions

A few years later I was working as a web programmer for a dot-com startup (back then we called it "webmaster"--yes, I am *that* old). The dot-com boom was in full swing, I was making good money, I was finishing up my first masters degree, I had a fat stack of (now worthless) stock options. Everything was coming together.

I had an opportunity to go to Melbourne Australia for work for a week. Easily one of the best cities in the world. I loved every minute of it. Back then I also held several Microsoft certifications. Those certifications were hot properties back then and I was highly sought after. So I'm in Melbourne having a totally innocuous conversation with the President of a private school in the city. They were desperate for a new network manager. When he heard I had a stack of Microsoft certifications and was pursuing a masters degree he offered me a job. Just like that. Out of the blue. Asked me is I would be willing to stop by the school, meet some of the staff, and start the formal interview process. I was clearly taken aback. Oddly, my first thought was with getting a work visa. "Not a problem" he said. "We desperately need technical people in Australia. With your skills I could get you a visa by the end of the week."

I turned down the offer. Shook his hand, said "this is very sudden so I need to think about it" and never called him back. I had a litany of excuses that seemed reasonable at the time but they were all bullshit. I was scared and I let fear make the decision for me.

<hr />

* Being human means making mistakes
* Mistakes naturally lead to regret
* But you need to learn from your mistakes and grow from them
* Don't carry your regret with you forever
* It will eat you up from the inside if you do

## No one wants to do bad work

So I'm back to work as the manager of the development team and one of my employees isn't meeting expectations. She was hired as an HTML author (that was a real job back then) but she really wanted to be a programmer. I hired her knowing that was her goal but she took the job knowing she didn't yet have the skills. We both knew she wasn't living up to her potential and we both knew why. Bus as the boss I had to make a decision. So I used her next performance review to let her make that decision.

I offered her two choices. I put two job "offers" in front of her. One was for "Sr. HTML Author" and the other was for "Jr. Programmer". Both had the same salary (the same thing she was currently making). One job clearly had *no* programming responsibilities. The other came with a 6-month probation period in which I could fire her without question if she didn't meet several expectations explicitly detailed in the offer. One offer entailed risk and the other didn't. I asked he to come back tomorrow with a signature on one and to throw the other away.

<hr />

* When someone isn't getting the job done there is always a reason
* Generally it isn't that the person is incapable of doing the job (thought occasionally it is)
* People generally want to do good work
* The problem is never as simple as "performance"
* Find the root of the problem and solve it

## Recognize when it's time to go

And then the dot-com bubble burst. Everything cam crashing down. You never realize just how dysfunctional a company is until things start to go bad. Turns out I was working for a very, very dysfunctional company. And things go bad.

As the webmaster I was the boss fo half the company. I reported directly to one owner. Everyone else at the company reported (directly or indirectly) to the other owner. The two owners started *really* disliking each other. Given my role I found myself in the middle of a lot of controversy. Admittedly, my personal performance wasn't the best at this time, either. I'm human, too, and the dysfunction affected me just like everyone else. So I decided to quit…

And got talked out of it. My boss had been one of my instructors while I was pursuing my undergrad. I considered him a friend. As my "friend" he talked me into staying. Staying was a mistake. I should have left.

<hr />

* The unknown is scary
* Sometimes it seems easier to stick with "the devil you know"
* Often a bad situation that we've learned how to live with seems less bad than the unknown that we'll face if we leave
* Usually we're completely wrong

## Business isn't personal

Six months later I was fired from the job I had tried to quit. My boss had asked me to stay because he and I had a history together. I truly believe he valued that history and I truly believe he wanted things to work out. But it wasn't going to. I was a bad fit for the company at the time. Despite all the work I did helping build the company from scratch my presence was disruptive. As profits started to shrink the ROI on my presence was getting lower. Keeping me was simply a bad business decision.

<hr />

* Some people are not a good fit for some jobs
* Some jobs are not a good fit for some people
* Recognizing this isn't personal

## But how you conduct business is

I was working from home at the time I was fired. A couple of weird things that happened in the previous months that made me paranoid. So I bluntly aksed my boss one day "Are you planning to get rid of me?" He denied it in every possible way. There was no way he would ever get rid of me. A month later he fired me.

By email.

He repaid my friendship and my loyalty by sending me an email telling me not to come in to work that day because I no longer had a job. He followed up by asking if we could meet somewhere outside the office so that I could return the company's computer and other assets.

I never faulted him for the decision to get rid of me, but I forever lost my respect for him over how he handled it.

<hr />

* Business is not personal but you conduct business is often intensely personal
* Never forget that employees aren't "assets" or "resources"
* Employees are human beings

## You are *not* your code

So I lose my job at the height of the dot-com bust and I can't find another job in Colorado. So I move to Ohio where the rest of my family lives and go to work for a company that makes banking systems. Soon after my boss, who I hoped would be a mentor, checks himself into rehab for a drug addiction and shortly thereafter dies of a heart attack aided by the drugs. In the aftermath I become the senior engineer of the worst code base I have ever seen.

Over the next five years this job provided my with many, many personal and professional lessons. Too many for now. But there is one important lesson I want to highlight.

After a ridiculous amount of work the team and I were able to get things back on track and start delivering updates to customers. We pulled every trick in the book to make it happen. We sold stuff we didn't have, we delivered stuff we knew wasn't ready, and we finished features while onsite installing the software. We were in non-stop crisis mode and we took risks. A lot of risks. One day in Grenada the risks caught up to us.

Everything about this particular delivery was bad from the beginning. Our customer had been bought by another company that preferred a competing product. There were insane political tensions at the bank. We were integrating with software from two companies we had never worked with and we had done woefully little testing. Pulling this off would have taken a miracle and we were all out. We couldn't get things to work and we had to back out and revert the system on our last day on the island. This was--by far--the lowest point in my career. The only reason my partner and I didn't get blind drunk that last night on the island is that we had an early flight and didn't want to miss it.

I never, ever, wanted to deliver work that awful.

<hr />

* You are *not* your code
* We programmers tend to take great pride in our work
* We tend to invest ourselves deeply in our work
* Unfortunately we often become so invested in our work we stop seeing where the work ends and we begin
* Your worth as a human being is far greater than the sum of your work
* Especially when you are in an environment where you don't have the opportunity to do your best work

## Your job is not your life

At the time that I was struggling with these work problems I was also a newlywed. And I was teaching part-time at two universities. I was burned out, overworked, surly, and generally not a pleasant person. For the first time in my life I had a *true* personal life. And it was in danger before it really had a chance to form.

So I quit my job.

<hr />

* It's OK to love your work
* In fact, we should all strive to find work we love
* But love of work is no substitute for real love
* Learn the difference

## Teams stand together

A few years later I'm working for a public broadcaster. One of the best companies I ever worked for. We were approaching our annual televised auction. My first. We pulled the code and databases from source control and discovered things were missing. The contractor who originally did the work hadn't put the database into source control and never created scripts to reproduce it. At one point we had a functioning auction system but we had done a ton of server work in the past year: buying new hardware, moving to virtual machines, decommissioning old servers, migrating servers, etc. Somewhere along the way we lost important stuff. Eventually we bit the bullet and told our VP and the VP in charge of the auction.

<hr />

* We never played the blame game
* We never pointed fingers
* We never said "he" or "she" or "I"
* We went together, stood together, and faced the consequences together

## Offer solutions, not excuses

Given all the changes we had implemented the prior year it's amazing we didn't lose more stuff (I have a habit of taking jobs where I'm asked to clean up a mess made by my predecessor). But excuses don't solve anything. When performing retrospectives it's important to understand causes and reasons. But those are different than excuses. More importantly, triage requires action. When we went to the VPs to admit our mistake we came ready with an action plan for how we would fix things in time for the auction.

<hr />

* We knew what needed done and promised to deliver something at least as good as what we lost
* We looked at everything that needed done and everyone took part of the work
* In some cases we even temporarily switched job responsibilities so the people with the right skills could focus on the critical tasks
* We all agreed to put in extra time
* Most importantly, we never gave the VPs a chance to ask "so what do we do now?"

## Failure are also opportunities

Turns out that many users were unhappy with the previous system. It was an online auction system but we weren't running an online auction. We were running a televised auction with online bidding. These are two very different things.

We had to start from scratch so we used the opportunity to learn the pain points of the old system and build something better suited to the problem.

<hr />

* Mistakes are often opportunities to reevaluate what you were doing in the first place
* When something goes bad, make it better
* Always leave things better than you found them

## Do the right thing

In my next job I found myself taking over a failed project (again). My predecessor was a good person but a bad fit in the role. One of the things he had done poorly was track the money. I spent an inordinate time trying to figure out who he had spent so much money and provided so little software to show for it. One of the things I discovered is that our pay scale for tech contractors was all over the board. Some were grossly overpaid and some were grossly underpaid. The lowest on the pay scale was so low I was embarrassed. But this was his first tech gig and he had been trying to break into the industry so he took what he could get.

I heard through the grapevine that this programmer was also talking to a local contracting firm. A very well-respected and well-known firm. With a few months of professional work under his belt he had more to talk about now. In the short time I knew him I recognized that he was smart, hard working, industrious, and probably had a great career ahead of him. Given the tight job market I didn't want to lose him, but I also knew we weren't paying him squat and couldn't offer him health insurance. Fortunately for me I knew the owner of the consulting company personally, so I gave him a call and met up with him at his office.

I cut through the BS and told him I knew he was talking to my programmer. He admitted he was. I told him that I would like to keep the programmer on my project but that I knew the value he would gain by jumping ship. So I suggested they give him a job then I contract him back to my project. We did some back-of-the-napkin calculations based on what they were thinking of offering him and we shook hands. They followed-up with the programmer and eventually everything came together. It cost me a lot more money but nothing that wasn't perfectly reasonable for the market at the time and nothing that my budget couldn't handle. Everyone won.

<hr />

* You have a conscience
* It's smarter than you are
* Sometimes it's very hard to do the right thing
* Do it anyway
* Your life will be better for it

## My team gets credit, I get blame

So we get the project turned around and we start cranking out code. We made some very pragmatic decisions but the funder was happy and stopped threatening to pull the funds. Then one day one of the members of the business team--someone I workers with at my previous job and someone with whom I shared tremendous mutual respect--got upset over a feature.

So we're sitting in the office and he is uncharacteristically angry. Fuming mad actually. I thought the actual bug was very minor but it was important to him so it was important to me. He kept asking me which programmer worked on the feature and I kept refusing to tell him.

"You're not going to tell me who this was, are you?" he asked. "No matter how hard I push."

"No" I said, "I am not." I continued. "I understand you are unhappy and I am going to do everything I can to make this right, but I won't throw one of my team under the bus. I am the boss. I am responsible. I set the expectations for my team, I set the standards for my team, I create their process and I assign them their work. We failed you, which means I failed them. You and I will talk as long as necessary to figure out how we can improve the process, make this right, and prevent it in the future. But I will not make this a finger pointing exercise. Point the finger at me, get your frustration out of your system, then we'll get to work."

<hr />

* When a team performs will the leader will get credit
* There is never a reason for a leader to steal credit from an individual team member
* Let everyone know the good work each team member is doing and you'll still look good as the leader
* But when things go bad, shield the team
* Take responsibility for your role as leader
* If an individual team member needs coaching do it in private
* People feel bad when their team makes a mistake
* Never compound it by dividing the team

## Be true to yourself

I ended up leaving that job to go back to programming. I've spent at least as much time over my career being the boss as I have being a coder. If the people I've worked with are to be believed, I'm pretty good at the whole boss thing. When I decided to go back to a non-boss role several people who knew me were very surprised. "But you're so good at it!" is the usual refrain.

Truth is, there is nothing I ever do as a manager that makes me as happy as writing code. The only good days are the days where I spend most of my time in Vim, writing code.

One of the guys on my team now worked with me on another project a few years ago. When we met up again to talk about this gig he noticed I was dressed nicer. ""Did you go out and but a bunch of nice clothes?" he asked. "Just the opposite" I explained. I had to buy a bunch of T-shirts when I worked with you last. When I started working with a bunch of young, hipster Rubyists I tried to fit in. Truth is I am neither young nor a hipster and I finally realized it was time I stopped pretending I was either.

<hr />

* You are who you are
* Embrace that, don't deny that
* Being good at something isn't the same thing as being happy doing it
* You will always be more happy and more genuine if you embrace the real you
* Screw everyone else if they don't like it

## Sometimes people screw up

I'm at my first non-management job in a few years and I'm immediately given two very difficult projects. I have the experience and my boss felt I would be the best fit. I developed what I thought were good solutions but they required us to do some things with the servers that we hadn't done before. I was very open about this with my boss and our devops person and I was assured things would get done.

After three months and numerous reminders from me things still hadn't gotten done. I repeatedly warned my boss that bad things might happen. Each time I was told that I was not going to be given the necessary server access to get it done myself but that our devops person would do. Eventually it came time to released and we had not adequately tested. And things went badly as expected.

To everyone's credit there was no blaming. We just got together as a team and fixed things. Once we got everything working it became clear that we would have found all the problems had we done the testing I had repeatedly asked for.

At my request there was a private meeting between myself, my boss, and our devops. I had no interest in making anything more public than it already was, but I wanted to discuss what went wrong so we could avoid making the same mistakes again. What I was told was "No one is blaming you, but sometimes things just happen. We handled it so we should just move on."

I couldn't disagree more.

I'm glad no on was blaming me because it wasn't my fault. In fact, I had made repeated attempts to avoid these exact problems. What I mostly took issue with, however, was the "sometimes things happen" attitude. Sure, sometimes things do just "happen" but sometimes people actually screw up. It's important to recognize the difference and act appropriately.

In this case, someone screwed up. We never should have gotten ourselves in that situation. It was completely avoidable.

<hr />

* People make mistakes, it's part of being human
* When you make a mistake be accountable
* Accept that you made a mistake
* It doesn't make you a bad person
* Denying the mistake does
* Learn from your mistakes and move on

## Take Risks

So now I'm nearly 20 years into my career. I've been a student, a teacher, a boss, and a teammate. I'm very established in my area and have a pretty good (thought not spotless) reputation. I work for a great company doing interesting work with some of the best tech professionals I have ever met. By all accounts my career is good. But that's no excuse for resting on my laurels.

I've never spoken at a major conference before. I've had plenty of experience speaking publicly but it's mostly been in the classroom and at user group meetings. Speaking in front of 100+ strangers at a conference is something I haven't done. But I'm proud of the work I'm doing these days and I think others can benefit from what we're doing so I want to share. So on a lark I submit three abstracts to a conference on the complete opposite end of the country. I had no expectation whatsoever that I would get invited to speak. Famous last words, as they say. So I presented last week at CascadiaRuby in Portland. Today I'm speaking at DevBootCamp in Chicago. In January I'm speaking at CodeMash in Ohio. And next week, in the biggest surprise of all, I'm speaking at *the* RubyConf in Miami Beach.

<hr />

* There are always opportunities to do more
* Never stop challenging yourself
* Some risks won't pay off
* But there are no rewards without risk
* As my father used to say, "The worst they can do is say 'No"

## Sometimes the best idea isn't yours

In all the hustle-and-bustle getting ready for CascadiaRuby and RubyConf I never got my DevBootCamp presentation where I wanted it. I had ambitious goals for the presentation. I pitched the idea to several people and they all liked it, but things just weren't coming together. A couple of days out from my speaking gig and I still didn't have a complete presentation and I was starting to get worried. But then I attended CascadiaRuby

One of the presenters gave a very personal, very powerful, and very moving presentation about lessons he had learned over a career and a computer programmer. He was about my age and had several similar experiences. I related deeply and loved every second of his presentation.

When I talked to him about it later he told me he had originally put the presentation together for a group of new programmers just starting out in their careers. A group very similar to the group I was going to be talking to a DevBootCamp.

Honestly, his presentation idea was just much better than mine.

<hr />

* Programmers are smart people by definition
* We also tend to be a clever and creative bunch, too
* We solve problems for a living and we revel in it
* But none of us have a monopoly on intelligence…
* or cleverness…
* or creativity…
* or innovation
* So we need to put our egos aside and recognize the intelligence, cleverness, creativity, and innovation of our peers
* And we need to celebrate diversity

## It's better to excel at Plan B

Despite our best intentions, sometimes our ideas just don't work out. And it's easy to get frustrated by that. We become emotionally invested in an idea because it *ours* and because it seemed so *good* at first. In the end that's meaningless. It either works or it doesn't. Sometimes we just need to "throw in the towel" and go with Plan B.

This presentation is the perfect example. I really, *really* wanted to present my original idea. It just wouldn't come together. I could have spent the day beating away at PowerPoint and trying to force something to come together. I may have even gotten it together well enough to fool my audience. But I would have known. But when I started working on Plan B things really seemed to fall into place. It just worked. I felt good about it. It seemed right.

Only you, my audience, can judge whether or not it worked. maybe it didn't. But I *know* that Plan B worked out much better than Plan A would have.

* It's better to excel at Plan B than to be mediocre at Plan A

## Do what you love, love what you do

My parting advice to you can be summed up in one word: *Love*

* Do what you love
* Love what you do
* Love your life
* Love your family
* Love your job
* Love your life

## This job is not about

And always remember:

* This job is not about the code
* This job is not about the tech
* This job is not about the problem
* This job is not about the solution

## It's about the people

Thank you.
